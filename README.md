# VaccineDatabase

This project designs a vaccine database using SQL and PHP. It consists of multiple parts, starting from the creation of an ER Diagram and ending at a performance analysis. UNCG's phpmyadmin was used to manage the database (https://csc471.uncg.edu/phpMyAdmin/) as this project was created for the course CSC471: Principles of Database Systems.

## Features
This database keeps a log of patients, their allergies, and whether or not they are insured. It also keeps a log of vaccines, vaccines' lot numbers, vaccination sites, and bills for patients. 

SQL commands were used to create and insert some data, as well as to answer certain questions about the data gathered. The fakerphp library was also used to generate fake data.

## Process
### Part 1 
This step involved creating an ER diagram of the database:

### Part 2 
This step involved creating a relational design:

### Part 3 
This step involved adding the SQL design. In this step, the SQL commands insert, create, update, join, inner join, and intersect were used. This step focused on creating tables for the database, inserting dummy data into those tables, updating data records, and answering questions about the data (such as 'What patients received a covid vaccine at Cone Health?').
