# VaccineDatabase

This project designs a vaccine database using SQL. It consists of multiple parts, starting from the creation of an ER Diagram and ending at a performance analysis. UNCG's phpmyadmin was used to manage the database (https://csc471.uncg.edu/phpMyAdmin/) as this project was created for CSC471: Principles of Database Systems.
