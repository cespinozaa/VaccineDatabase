# VaccineDatabase

This project designs a vaccine database using SQL and PHP. It consists of multiple parts, starting from the creation of an ER Diagram and ending at a performance analysis. UNCG's phpmyadmin was used to manage the database (https://csc471.uncg.edu/phpMyAdmin/) as this project was created for the course CSC471: Principles of Database Systems.

## Features
This database keeps a log of patients, their allergies, and whether or not they are insured. It also keeps a log of vaccines, vaccines' lot numbers, vaccination sites, and bills for patients. 

SQL commands were used to create and insert some data, as well as to answer certain questions about the data gathered. The fakerphp library was also used to generate fake data.

## Process
Part 1 was creating an ER diagram.

Part 2 was creating a relational design.
